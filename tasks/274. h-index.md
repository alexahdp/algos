## 274. H-Index
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index

### Description:
Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

---

**Example 1:**  
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]  
Output: 3  
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.  
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.  

**Example 2:**  
Input: citations = [1,3,1]  
Output: 1  

### Solution:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        int papers = citations.length;
        int[] citation_buckets = new int[papers + 1];

        for (int citation : citations) {
            citation_buckets[Math.min(citation, papers)] += 1;
        }

        int cumulative_papers = 0;
        for (int hIndex = papers; hIndex >= 0; hIndex--) {
            cumulative_papers += citation_buckets[hIndex];
            if (cumulative_papers >= hIndex) {
                return hIndex;
            }
        }
        return cumulative_papers;
    }
}
```
