## 198. House Robber
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber

### Description: 
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

**Example 1:**  
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]  
Output: 4  
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).  
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.  

**Example 2:**  
Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]  
Output: 12  
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).  
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12  

### Solution: 
```python
from functools import lru_cache

class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        """
        bottom-up
        Time: O(n)
        Space: O(n)
        """
        N = len(nums)
        
        prev_1 = 0
        prev_2 = 0
        current = 0
        for i in range(2, N+2):
            current = max(prev_2 + nums[i-2], prev_1)
            prev_2 = prev_1
            prev_1 = current
        return current


    def rob11(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        """
        bottom-up
        Time: O(n)
        Space: O(n)
        """
        N = len(nums)
        table = [0] * (N+2)
        for i in range(2, len(table)):
            table[i] = max(table[i-2] + nums[i-2], table[i - 1])
        return table[-1]


    def rob0(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        """
        top-down
        Time: O(n)
        Space: O(n)
        """
        N = len(nums)

        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i):
            if i >= N:
                return 0

            return max(dp(i+2) + nums[i], dp(i+3) + nums[i])    
        return max(dp(0), dp(1))
```
