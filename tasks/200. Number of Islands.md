## 200. Number of Islands
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands

### Description: 
Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.  

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**  
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
```
Output: 1  

**Example 2:**
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
```
Output: 3


### Solution: 
```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
      number_islands = 0
      rows = len(grid)
      cols = len(grid[0])
      
      directions = [
        [0, 1],
        [-1, 0],
        [0, -1],
        [1, 0]
      ]
      
      def mark_island(i, j):
        if i < 0 or i == rows:
            return
        if j < 0 or j == cols:
          return
        if grid[i][j] == "0":
          return
        grid[i][j] = "0"
        for d in directions:
          mark_island(i + d[0], j + d[1])
        
      
      for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
          if grid[i][j] == "1":
            number_islands += 1
            mark_island(i, j)
      
      return number_islands
```
