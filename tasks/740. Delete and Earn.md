## 740. Delete and Earn
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-and-earn

### Description: 
You are given an integer array nums. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:  

Pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 and every element equal to nums[i] + 1.  
Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times.  

---

**Example 1:**  
Input: nums = [3,4,2]  
Output: 6  
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:  
- Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].  
- Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = [].  
You earn a total of 6 points.  


**Example 2:**  
Input: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]  
Output: 9  
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:  
- Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = [3,3].  
- Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3].  
- Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = [].  
You earn a total of 9 points.  

### Solution: 
```python
from collections import defaultdict
# [3,3,3,4,2,2]

class Solution(object):
  def deleteAndEarn(self, nums):
    points = defaultdict(int)
    maxNum = 0
    
    for num in nums:
      points[num] += num
      maxNum = max(maxNum, num)
    
    table = [0] * (maxNum + 1)
    table[0] = 0
    table[1] = points[1]
    
    for i in range(2, maxNum+1):
      table[i] = max(table[i - 1], table[i - 2] + points[i])
    
    return table[-1]
