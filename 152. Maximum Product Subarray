## 152. Maximum Product Subarray
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray

### Description: 
Given an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return the product.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

Note that the product of an array with a single element is the value of that element.

---

**Example 1:**  

Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
Example 2:

**Example 2:**  

Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.

### Solution: 
```java
class Solution {

  /**
  Because, nums can contain negative numbers and a product of 2 negative numbers is positive,
  we should consider such cases as candidates for max values.
  So, we are going to have 2 counters: for max values and min_values. Min_values should contain negative
  product, but it will turn out to be positive when current nums is negative
   */
  public int maxProduct(int[] nums) {
    int max = nums[0];
    int maxProduct = nums[0];
    int minProduct = nums[0];

    for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
      if (nums[i] < 0) {
        int box = maxProduct;
        maxProduct = minProduct;
        minProduct = box;
      }

      maxProduct = Math.max(nums[i], nums[i] * maxProduct);
      minProduct = Math.min(nums[i], nums[i] * minProduct);

      max = Math.max(max, maxProduct);
    }

    return max;
  }
}

```
